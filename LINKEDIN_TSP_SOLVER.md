# LinkedIn Post — TSP Solver: When Neural Networks Race to Find the Best Route

---

**I built a visual computer that solves one of math's hardest problems — and you can watch it think.**

You know how Google Maps finds the fastest route for your delivery driver? Now imagine the driver has to visit 10 stops, return home, and take the absolute shortest path.

That's the **Travelling Salesman Problem** — a puzzle that has haunted computer science for 70 years. With just 10 cities, there are **362,880 possible routes**. With 20 cities — more routes than atoms in the universe.

No known algorithm can solve it quickly as the number of cities grows. This is at the heart of the famous **P vs NP** question — arguably the biggest unsolved problem in all of mathematics (there's a $1 million prize if you crack it).

So I built something different.

**Instead of checking routes one by one, I let them race.**

Picture a glowing 3D network of cities floating in space. Every possible connection between them is visible — a dim web of "what if" paths. When you click, an energy pulse explodes outward and races through ALL routes simultaneously.

Here's the trick: the **optimal route has stronger connections**. So the pulse travels through it more intensely. The best path literally **glows brighter** than the rest.

It's like dropping a stone into a pool shaped like your map — the ripples find every path at once, but the shortest channel carries the strongest wave.

This is how nature solves hard problems:
- Light always finds the fastest path through glass (Fermat's principle)
- Soap bubbles find the minimum surface area instantly
- Slime molds have solved subway maps

**The catch?** This doesn't actually prove P = NP. You'd need a physically impossible number of parallel paths for large problems. But as a visual intuition for WHY these problems are so fascinating — and how parallel systems approach them — it's a powerful demo.

**Try it yourself** (click the canvas, press 8 for TSP mode):

The browser solves 362,880 routes instantly, then lets you watch the answer emerge as light.

Built with Three.js, TypeScript, and custom GLSL shaders. No backend. Runs entirely in your browser.

## Suggested media

Attach a screen recording or GIF of the TSP Solver formation with a pulse racing through it. The visual alone is the hook — the text explains what they're seeing.

## Posting tips

1. **Lead image/video** — the TSP formation with pulse mid-propagation (the "bloom" screenshot works great)
2. **First line is the hook** — "I built a visual computer..." appears above the fold
3. **No jargon until paragraph 3** — Google Maps analogy lands first
4. **The $1M prize line** creates curiosity
5. **"Try it yourself" CTA** with direct GitHub link drives engagement
6. **Last line is quotable** — people reshare punchy closers
