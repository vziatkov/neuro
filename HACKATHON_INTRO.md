# Hackathon Introduction Message

---

Hi everyone! 👋

I'm **Vitalii**, and I'm working on **Neuro Learning Studio** — an interactive 3D educational platform for children (ages 5-10) that combines AI-powered content generation with immersive visual learning.

## What we're building:

**Neuro Learning Studio** transforms learning math, logic, and problem-solving into an engaging 3D experience. Think of it as a virtual school where:

- **Google Gemini** generates personalized, adaptive learning tasks in real-time based on each child's progress
- **Freepik** creates consistent, beautiful character assistants and visual environments that make learning fun
- **Qdrant** powers intelligent task recommendations and maintains visual consistency across generated content
- **Three.js** renders everything in an interactive 3D neural network visualization — children's progress literally lights up the network as they learn

## The vision:

Instead of boring worksheets, kids interact with a living, breathing 3D world where:
- Each correct answer creates energy pulses through the neural network
- AI adapts difficulty dynamically (not too easy, not too hard — the "zone of proximal development")
- Personalized character guides generated by Freepik keep children engaged
- Vector search ensures consistent visual style and finds similar tasks for practice

## Tech stack:

- **Three.js** for 3D visualization
- **TypeScript** + **Vite** for modern development
- **Modular architecture** ready for API integration
- Already have a working prototype with adaptive difficulty system

## What we need:

Looking to partner with:
- **Full-stack developers** who love creative AI applications
- **Designers** interested in educational UX
- Anyone excited about making learning magical for kids! 🎨

We have the foundation, the vision, and the APIs — now we need a team to bring it to life for the hackathon!

**Let's build something that makes kids fall in love with learning!** ✨

Looking forward to connecting and collaborating!
