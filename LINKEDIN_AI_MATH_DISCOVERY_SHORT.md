Great discussion! I want to push back on the idea that AI "can't make discoveries" — especially using your √–1 example.

When we introduced i and defined i² = –1, we did something profound: we **extended our model** of numbers. We moved from ℝ to ℂ by adjoining a new element with a relation. This is exactly what modern AI systems excel at: **manipulating formal structures**, not just following data.

**Real examples:**
- AlphaGeometry solved 25/30 IMO problems (creative constructions)
- FunSearch discovered new algorithms for cap sets
- Formal provers + LLMs are finding new lemmas in active research

The constraint isn't "past data" — it's the **logic of the formal system**. AI can add symbols, extend structures, check consistency, explore consequences. That's discovery.

**The fifth postulate example:** Instead of trying to prove it for 2000 years, we could construct a model where it's false → hyperbolic geometry. This model-building is exactly what AI does systematically.

**P vs NP:** Not about data — it's about proof structures, complexity classes, combinatorial search. AI can explore huge spaces of formal possibilities, find extremal examples, propose new barriers.

**Where humans still excel:** Recognizing beauty and meaning. The "this is deep" instinct. But if discovery means "finding new structures in formal systems," AI is already a powerful collaborator.

The right question isn't "Can AI discover √–1?" but "What mathematics emerges when human intuition for beauty meets machine power over formal structures?"

Complex numbers, non-Euclidean geometry, P vs NP — all sit at that intersection: **structure + imagination**.

What do you think? 🤔
