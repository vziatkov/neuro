# Image Generation Prompt for LinkedIn Article

## Main Prompt (Detailed)

```
Create a professional, modern infographic-style illustration for a LinkedIn article about weather forecast clustering.

COMPOSITION:
- Split-screen design: Left side (traditional approach) vs Right side (new approach)
- Clean, minimalist aesthetic suitable for professional social media
- White or very light gray background
- Dimensions: 1200x627px (LinkedIn article header standard)

LEFT SIDE - "Traditional Averaging":
- Show 3-4 small weather forecast grids (20x15 cells each)
- Each grid has different blue precipitation patterns (some areas darker blue = more rain)
- All grids point with arrows to a single larger grid in the center
- The resulting averaged grid is blurred/washed out, showing loss of detail
- Text label: "Averaging → Loss of structure"
- Use muted colors, grayscale with slight blue tint

RIGHT SIDE - "Object-Oriented Clustering":
- Show the same 3-4 weather forecast grids at the top
- Below, show 3 distinct colored clusters/groups:
  - Cluster A: Orange color, labeled "Scenario A (8/10 models)"
  - Cluster B: Green color, labeled "Scenario B (5/10 models)"  
  - Cluster C: Purple color, labeled "Scenario C (2/10 models)"
- Each cluster contains simplified weather object shapes (blob-like precipitation areas)
- Arrows connect grids to clusters showing the transformation
- Text label: "Clustering → Distinct scenarios"
- Use vibrant but professional colors

VISUAL STYLE:
- Modern data visualization aesthetic
- Clean lines, no clutter
- Professional typography (sans-serif, clear and readable)
- Subtle shadows or borders to separate sections
- Icons or simple illustrations, not photorealistic
- Color palette:
  - Blues: #4A90E2, #2E5C8A (for weather data)
  - Orange: #FF6B35 (Scenario A)
  - Green: #4ECDC4 (Scenario B)
  - Purple: #9B59B6 (Scenario C)
  - Gray: #E8E8E8 (background)

TEXT ELEMENTS:
- Main title at top: "Object-Oriented Weather Clustering"
- Subtitle: "Beyond Averaging: Revealing Hidden Scenarios"
- Keep text minimal and readable
- Use professional font (like Inter, Roboto, or similar)

MOOD:
- Professional and trustworthy
- Innovative but not overly flashy
- Data-driven and scientific
- Clear and educational
```

## Alternative Simpler Version

```
A clean, professional diagram showing the difference between averaging and clustering weather forecasts:

LAYOUT:
- Top section: 3 weather forecast grids side by side (each showing different blue precipitation patterns)
- Middle section: Two diverging paths
  - Left path (red X or down arrow): "Averaging" → single blurred/washed out grid
  - Right path (green check or up arrow): "Clustering" → 3 distinct colored groups (orange, green, purple)
- Bottom: Title "Object-Oriented Weather Clustering"

STYLE:
- Minimalist infographic
- White background
- Blue for weather data (#4A90E2)
- Orange/Green/Purple for scenarios
- Clean icons and simple shapes
- Professional typography
- 1200x627px
```

## For DALL-E / Midjourney / Stable Diffusion

### DALL-E Style:
```
Professional infographic illustration, split-screen design, left side shows 3 weather forecast grids averaging into one blurred grid with text "Averaging → Loss of structure", right side shows same grids clustering into 3 distinct colored groups (orange, green, purple) labeled "Scenario A/B/C" with text "Clustering → Distinct scenarios", minimalist style, clean lines, modern data visualization aesthetic, white background, professional typography, 1200x627px, suitable for LinkedIn article header
```

### Midjourney Style:
```
professional infographic, weather forecast clustering comparison, split screen design, left: averaging approach showing blurred result, right: clustering approach showing distinct colored scenarios, minimalist style, clean modern design, data visualization aesthetic, white background, professional typography, 1200x627px --style raw --ar 16:9
```

### Stable Diffusion (with ControlNet):
```
professional infographic illustration, weather forecast clustering, split-screen comparison, averaging vs clustering, minimalist design, clean lines, modern data visualization, white background, professional typography, 1200x627px
Negative prompt: photorealistic, realistic, detailed, cluttered, messy, low quality
```
