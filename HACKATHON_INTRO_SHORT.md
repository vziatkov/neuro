# Hackathon Introduction (Short Discord Version)

---

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm **Vitalii**, a developer working on **Neuro Learning Studio** — an interactive 3D school platform for kids (5-10 years old) that makes learning math and logic actually fun.

## The idea:

Instead of boring worksheets, kids learn in a beautiful 3D world where:
- **Gemini** generates personalized tasks that adapt to each child's progress in real-time
- **Freepik** creates consistent character assistants and visual environments
- **Qdrant** powers smart recommendations and keeps visual style consistent
- **Three.js** renders everything as an interactive neural network — when kids solve problems, the network lights up with energy pulses ✨

Think of it as a virtual school where learning feels like playing a game, but with real educational value.

## What we have:

- Working 3D visualization engine (Three.js)
- Adaptive difficulty system prototype
- Modular TypeScript architecture ready for API integration
- Clear vision and passion for making learning magical

## What we need:

Looking for partners who are excited about:
- Creative AI applications
- Educational technology
- Building something that helps kids learn better

**If you're a full-stack dev, designer, or just someone who loves the idea of combining AI with beautiful visuals for education — let's chat!** 🚀

This could be a game-changer for how kids learn, and I'd love to build it with an awesome team.

Looking forward to connecting! 💫
